## Introduction

A genetic algorithm (GA) is an optimization and search technique based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. This repository implements a GA to solve the shortest path problem on a graph, which is a common problem in fields like operations research, computer science, and network routing.

## Features

- Implemented in Python
- Customizable population size and mutation rate
- Configurable crossover and selection methods
- Visual representation of the graph and paths
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm-shortest-path.git
cd genetic-algorithm-shortest-path
pip install -r requirements.txt
