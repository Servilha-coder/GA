## Introduction

A genetic algorithm (GA) is an optimization and search technique based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. This repository implements a GA to solve the shortest path problem on a graph, which is a common problem in fields like operations research, computer science, and network routing.

## Features

- Implemented in Python
- Customizable population size and mutation rate
- Configurable crossover and selection methods
- Visual representation of the graph and paths
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm-shortest-path.git
cd genetic-algorithm-shortest-path
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
The main script to run the genetic algorithm is main.py. You can configure the parameters of the genetic algorithm by editing the config.json file.

## Configuration
population_size: Number of individuals in the population
mutation_rate: Probability of mutation in an individual
num_generations: Number of generations to evolve
crossover_method: Method to use for crossover (e.g., one-point, two-point)
selection_method: Method to use for selection (e.g., tournament, roulette-wheel)
graph: Representation of the graph as an adjacency matrix or list
Running the Algorithm
bash
Copy code
python main.py
## Example
Here's an example of how to use the genetic algorithm to find the shortest path in a sample graph.

Define your graph in config.json:
json
Copy code
{
  "population_size": 100,
  "mutation_rate": 0.01,
  "num_generations": 200,
  "crossover_method": "one-point",
  "selection_method": "tournament",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
    "edges": {
      "A": {"B": 1, "C": 4},
      "B": {"A": 1, "C": 2, "D": 5},
      "C": {"A": 4, "B": 2, "D": 1},
      "D": {"B": 5, "C": 1, "E": 3},
      "E": {"D": 3}
    }
  }
}
Run the genetic algorithm:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Observe the output, which will show the shortest path found and its distance.
